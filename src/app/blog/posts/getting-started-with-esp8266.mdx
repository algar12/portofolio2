## Introduction

The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip with full TCP/IP stack and microcontroller capability. It's perfect for IoT projects where you need to connect sensors and devices to the internet.

## What You'll Need

- ESP8266 NodeMCU board
- USB cable (micro USB)
- Arduino IDE installed
- Basic understanding of C/C++

## Setting Up Arduino IDE

1. Download and install Arduino IDE from arduino.cc
2. Add ESP8266 board support via Board Manager
3. Select your board (NodeMCU 1.0)
4. Choose the correct COM port

## Your First ESP8266 Program

```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

const char* ssid = "Your_WiFi_SSID";
const char* password = "Your_Password";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }
  
  Serial.println("WiFi connected!");
  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
}

void loop() {
  // Your code here
}
```

## Next Steps

Once you have WiFi connectivity working, you can explore:
- Reading sensor data
- Sending data to cloud servers
- MQTT protocol for IoT messaging
- Building web interfaces

Happy making! 🚀
