## What is MQTT?

MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency networks. It's perfect for IoT applications where devices need to send small amounts of data efficiently.

## Key Concepts

### Publish/Subscribe Model

Unlike HTTP's request/response, MQTT uses publish/subscribe:
- **Publishers** send messages to topics
- **Subscribers** receive messages from topics they're interested in
- **Broker** manages message distribution

### Quality of Service (QoS)

MQTT offers three QoS levels:
- **QoS 0**: At most once (fire and forget)
- **QoS 1**: At least once (acknowledged delivery)
- **QoS 2**: Exactly once (assured delivery)

## Use Cases in IoT

- Sensor data collection
- Remote device control
- Real-time monitoring
- Smart home automation

## Getting Started

Use libraries like PubSubClient for ESP8266 to implement MQTT in your projects. Many cloud platforms (AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub) support MQTT natively.
